# AI-Driven Bitcoin Trading Bot with Crowd Wisdom

## Project Overview

The AI-Driven Bitcoin Trading Bot with Crowd Wisdom is an innovative project that combines artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and collective intelligence to create a sophisticated Bitcoin trading system. This project leverages the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts to ensure transparent and secure operations.
The core idea is to use an AI model to analyze Bitcoin market trends and make trading decisions, while allowing users to stake Bitcoin and vote on these decisions, incorporating crowd wisdom into the trading strategy.

## Key Features

1. **AI-Driven Trading Decisions**: An AI model analyzes Bitcoin market trends and makes trading decisions.
2. **Crowd Wisdom Integration**: Users can stake Bitcoin to participate in voting on the AI's decisions.
3. **Transparent Execution**: All trades and profit distributions are executed transparently on the Stacks blockchain.
4. **Decentralized Governance**: The system allows for community participation in decision-making.

## Technical Stack

- **Blockchain**: Stacks
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Frontend**: (To be determined - e.g., React, Vue.js)
- **AI Model**: (To be implemented - e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)

## Smart Contract Structure

The core of the project is the `CrowdWisdomBot` Clarity smart contract. Here's an overview of its main components:

1. **Data Storage**:
   - `ai-decision`: Stores the current AI trading decision.
   - `total-staked`: Keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin staked.
   - `user-stakes`: Maps users to their staked amounts.
   - `user-votes`: Records user votes on AI decisions.

2. **Key Functions**:
   - `stake-bitcoin`: Allows users to stake Bitcoin to participate.
   - `vote`: Enables staked users to vote on AI decisions.
   - `update-ai-decision`: Admin function to update the AI's decision (to be replaced with AI integration).

3. **Read-Only Functions**:
   - `get-ai-decision`: Retrieves the current AI decision.
   - `get-total-staked`: Returns the total amount of Bitcoin staked.
   - `get-user-stake`: Retrieves a specific user's staked amount.
   - `get-user-vote`: Fetches a user's current vote.

## Project Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Initial smart contract implementation
   - Basic staking and voting mechanisms
   - Manual AI decision updates

2. **Phase 2**: AI Model Integration
   - Develop and integrate AI model for Bitcoin trend analysis
   - Automate decision-making process

3. **Phase 3**: Frontend Development
   - Create user interface for staking, voting, and viewing decisions
   - Implement data visualization for market trends and bot performance

4. **Phase 4**: Trading Execution
   - Implement secure, automated trading based on AI decisions and crowd voting
   - Develop profit distribution mechanism

5. **Phase 5**: Advanced Features
   - Implement governance mechanisms for parameter adjustments
   - Develop reputation system for successful voters
   - Explore integration with other DeFi protocols

## Getting Started

(Instructions for setting up the development environment, running the contract, and testing will be added as the project progresses.)
